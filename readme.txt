University of Houston | Alumni Services

	In this repository I have created a sample email demo for the University of Houston College of Alumni Services. This is a personal project and is not intended for commercial use. For those interested in reviewing the entire case study I have included the initial sketch file and high fidelity mockup, which can be found in the repository.  All attributes to images, logos, and icons can be found below. 


Software:

Adobe XD - UI Design Mockup
Atom  - HTML/CSS code



Notes:

Please note as this project is intended for use inside of email and email clients. In order to ensure maximum compatibility the HTML and CSS code are found written on the same index.html file. The code was written using 2019 best practices, and may need to be adapted to table form to work in older email clients.
